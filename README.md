# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Learn. Build. Deploy.

Hi, Iâ€™m building cybersecurity and IT labs from scratch â€” one virtual machine at a time.

This repo is home base for my learning-in-public journey. Iâ€™m working my way into the cybersecurity and IT world by:
- ðŸ”§ Building real-world home labs
- ðŸ“¹ Sharing tutorials and walkthroughs on YouTube (soon!)
- ðŸ’» Creating resources for new learners, career changers, and lab nerds like me
